## [v0.2.0] â€“ 2025-10-18
### ðŸŽ¯ Iteration 2 â€“ Model Improvement & CI Polish

#### ðŸš€ Changes
- Upgraded model from **LinearRegression** â†’ **Ridge(alpha=1.0)** for improved generalization.
- Integrated model versioning via `MODEL_VERSION` environment variable.
- Enhanced `/health` endpoint to report the actual trained model version.
- Improved training logs and artifact consistency.
- Refined CI/CD pipelines for reproducibility and cleaner metrics outputs.

#### ðŸ“Š Model Performance Comparison
| Metric | v0.1.0 (LinearRegression) | v0.2.0 (Ridge) | Î” Improvement |
|---------|----------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **RMSE** | 54.82 | **53.78** | â†“ 1.9 % |
| **Seed** | 42 | 42 | â€” |
| **Data Split** | 80/20 fixed | 80/20 fixed | â€” |
| **Model Type** | `LinearRegression` | `Ridge(alpha=1.0)` | âœ… Regularized |

> The Ridge model slightly reduced RMSE and is expected to generalize better on unseen patient data due to regularization.

#### ðŸ§± Technical Notes
- Rebuilt image: `ghcr.io/samsadn/maio:v0.2.0`
- Artifacts: `artifacts/model.joblib` and `artifacts/metrics.json` (baked in release image)
- CI/CD smoke tests passed (`/health` = 200, `/predict` = 200)

## [v0.1.0] â€“ 2025-10-10
### ðŸŽ¬ Initial Baseline Release
- Implemented **StandardScaler + LinearRegression** baseline model.
- Established GitHub Actions CI pipeline:
  - Linting (`ruff`)
  - Unit tests (`pytest`)
  - Artifact upload (`model.joblib`, `metrics.json`)
- Built and published Docker image `ghcr.io/samsadn/maio:v0.1.0`.
- Added FastAPI endpoints:
  - `/health` â€“ returns service status and model version
  - `/predict` â€“ returns numeric disease progression prediction
- Initial RMSE: **54.82**

### ðŸ§­ Versioning Policy
Releases follow **semantic versioning**:
- `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Each tagged version automatically triggers retraining, Docker build, and GHCR publish via `release.yml`.

### ðŸ“¦ Repository Artifacts
All artifacts are stored under `/artifacts`:
- `model.joblib` â€“ trained model pipeline  
- `metrics.json` â€“ evaluation metrics  
- Logged and attached in each GitHub Release.
